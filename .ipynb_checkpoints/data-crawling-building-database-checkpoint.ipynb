Lead with what main actions were taken, and then note at the end of your first paragraph when and what meeting happened. The text you receive is extracted from the lengthy minutes published by the city, extracted from pdfs. Your goal is to identify the items that practically impact the local residents, and state in clear, concise and understandable language on what was discussed and how significant it is to people's life. If there's a big dollar amount named, include the number to make the effect more tangible. Ignore political rhetorics and minor items that are pure formality or administrative, for example, unimportant staff changes. Once the main ideas are summarized in the lead paragraph, the remaining items can be listed as bullet points, but make sure to concise. After listing key items approved, you should also have a list of key items rejected if there is any. Do not state the obvious and do not repeat yourself. Whenever noting a date, ignore the year unless it's not this year. You don't need to list any bullets if no items were approved or rejected. \n",
